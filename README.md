This is the STUDENT README
In addition to the write up, you will be given this markdown file to unerstan how things work here.

# Student Readme Guide
## Folder Descriptions
Code is the housing for all of the original and related functionality

Data is unrelated for the purposes of this project

HTML_Test Environment is the housing for the html-dump grabbing and pre-preprocessing files

Processed is a clean warehouse folder for obsolete htmls that have been through preprocessing. They are kept here or visual clarity.

## Best Practice
If you are testing code, it is reccomended that you cd into HTML_Test Environment for creating the data set and then moving it into Code. For the functionality we used to collect data and run our experiments you would have Code as your active directory.
